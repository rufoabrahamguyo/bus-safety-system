# Camera Configuration
cameras:
  front: https://10.0.17.113:8080/video       # Phone camera for front view
  rear: https://10.0.101.135:8080/video      # Phone camera for rear view
  left: https://10.0.16.137:8080/video       # Phone camera for left mirror
  right: 3      # USB camera index for right mirror (not connected)
  driver: 0     # Laptop built-in camera ONLY for driver face monitoring

# Detection Settings
detection:
  model: "yolov8n.pt"  # YOLOv8 model (n=nano, s=small, m=medium)
  confidence_threshold: 0.5
  classes_of_interest: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7]  # person, bicycle, car, motorcycle, bus, truck
  danger_zone_radius: 3.0  # meters - objects within this distance trigger alerts

# Drowsiness Detection
drowsiness:
  ear_threshold: 0.2        # Eye Aspect Ratio threshold (lower = more sensitive)
  consecutive_frames: 10    # Frames with closed eyes before alert (at 30fps = ~0.33s) - REDUCED for faster detection
  perclos_threshold: 0.3    # Percentage of time eyes closed (PERCLOS metric)
  head_tilt_threshold: 20.0  # Head tilt angle in degrees before alert (pitch/yaw/roll) - improved accuracy
  head_tilt_consecutive: 5  # Consecutive frames with head tilt before alert

# Bird's Eye View Settings
